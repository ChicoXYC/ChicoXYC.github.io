This is an open source text book for communication students to learn Python and data skills, which also opened at Hong Kong Baptist University in year 2017-2019. Most of the notes are composed by me and @hupili. For the notes and tutorials, please refer [here](https://github.com/hupili/python-for-data-and-media-communication-gitbook).

If you have encountered any problems and issues during the study, you can open up a github issue you contact me here.
